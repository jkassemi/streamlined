StreamLined for Rails 3.0-pre
==================================

This is a very basic raw port of the Streamlined Framework for 
Rails3.0-pre. 

Actually it is not fully tested but it seems to work for all the CRUD methods
(plus search) and it correctly implements its basic layout. 

For more informations please visit the official Streamline github page
